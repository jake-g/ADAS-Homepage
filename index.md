# Advanced Driver Assist Team


#### Goal
Develop innovative advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) for the UW EcoCAR to accelerate the advent of fully autonomous cars.

#### Background
The UW EcoCAR team has been around for 5 years and is beginning year three of four in the current competition. The vehicle we are interfacing with is a performance 2016 hybrid electric Camaro, however the design intent is to make technology compatible with all modern vehicles.The ADAS team was introduced at the start of year two to introduce modern autopilot and infotainment systems to the UW EcoCAR vehicle. In year two, the focus was developing computer vision and classification techniques, vehicle simulators, embedded hardware and infotainment demos. The team has ranked in the top three out of 17 schools in all presentations and deliverables so far.
